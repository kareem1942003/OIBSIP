          Taha Hussein Ali bin Salama (1306 AH / November 14, 1889 - 1393 AH /
          October 28, 1973 AD), known as “Taha Hussein”, was an Egyptian writer
          and critic, nicknamed the dean of Arabic literature. He is considered
          one of the most prominent figures in the modern Arab literary
          movement. Taha Hussein's ideas and positions still raise controversy
          today. He studied at Al-Azhar, then joined the National University
          when it opened in 1908. He obtained his doctorate in 1914 and was sent
          to France to complete his studies. He returned to Egypt to work as a
          professor of history and then a professor of Arabic language. He
          worked as Dean of the Faculty of Arts, then Director of Alexandria
          University, then Minister of Education. Among his most famous books
          are: On Pre-Islamic Poetry (1926) and The Future of Culture in Egypt
          (1938). He has been nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature
          twenty-one times.
